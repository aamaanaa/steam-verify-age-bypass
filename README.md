## Steam verify age bypass
Bypasses the anoying age promt on the Steam Store page.

Due to legal requirements, steam is forced to always request your age when browsing games with a PEGI rating of 16 or higher. This disables that nonsense once and for all.

## Usage
You have 2 options:

- Build the source code from [`source (RTFM)`](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/compile-install)
- Or, use the precompiled (*- Linux btw*) binary from the [`releases page->`](https://github.com/aamaanaa/steam-verify-age-bypass/releases/download/v1.0.0/bypas.elf)
  
Next, open up a terminal and do the following:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x ./bypas.elf
# Run it
./bypas.elf

# Results in the following output, send to stdout of your terminal:

implementing bypass...
Bypass completed successfully! You can now open Steam and access the store without age verification.
You may close the program.
```

And that is all.
